## Domain Description ##
I have choosen Online Shopping mobile application as domain for my project. I have choosen this because I want to offer convinience and instant ease-of-access to users in online shopping. It's built on responsive interface and it will help and guide users with this 'ease-of-navigation' process. 
Daraz application is my motivation as it has built some amazing features and is also user-friendly.

## Tasks Performed ##
I saw in class that the actual reason of using a device or interacting with an interface is to accomplish a task. Following are around 10 tasks that I think users performs in my domain of choosing where good HCI can help people.

 ### Task 1: Signup/Login###
The first task that all the users perform is Signup/Login to the application. By doing so, they can access all the features and needs they are looking for in an online shopping store.

### Task 2: Shop By Category###
In dashboard, you can easily shop quality products from categories of your choice. There are multiple categories of every day life according to users need.

### Task 3: Explore our top deals###
With categories that you shop, you will also explore our top deals that will help you better to get to know our products and their speciality.

### Task 4: Add Quantity###
After selecting the product, you can add more qunatity of the item.

### Task 5: Product Details###
The most important thing while shopping is to know all the necessary information related to the product. That is why I will provide all the details below the selected product.

### Task 6: Buy Now/Add to Cart###
After selecting the product, you can buy or add product to the cart.

### Task 7: Responsive Interface###
The main focus of developing this application is to provide best interface to the user which will ease them, provide support and fulfill their needs and can further be modified.

### Task 8: Provide Security###
The application provides security to the users from other devices.

### Task 9: My Whishlist###
The online shopping app is where your wishlist come true. You can add your favourite products to your wishlist and can check-out when the price drops.

### Task 10: Easy Returns###
This online shopping app also has a very simple refund process. You can initiate returns if your product is defective, incorrect or incomplete at the time of delivery.

 
# #Prospect Technology Use ##
The technology that I will use to make the HCI more invisible is inventory tracking, stock availability and provide security to the online shopping application to complete my tasks effectively using android studio.
